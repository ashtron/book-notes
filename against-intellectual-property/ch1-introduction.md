# Introduction


* Example used throughout the chapter: [James Watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Watt)'s steam engine patents inhibited steam engine innovation and adoption


* *The wasteful effort to suppress competition and obtain special privileges is referred to by economists as **rent-seeking behavior**.*

  * *Watt's inventive skills were badly allocated: we find him spending more time engaged in legal action to establish and preserve his monopoly than in the actual improvement and production of his engine.*

* Adoption was slow because the patent *[kept] prices high and [prevented] others from producing cheaper or better steam engines*


* There are three main types of intellectual property

  * **Trademarks**
    * Ways of identifying producers
    * Using someone else's trademark is misrepresentation, so the legitimacy of trademarks is not really disputed
    
  * **Patents**
    * *apply to specific implementations of ideas*
    * *provide relatively broad protection: no one can legally use the same idea, even if he or she independently rediscovers it, without permission from the patent holder*

  * **Copyrights**
    * *narrower in scope, protecting only the specific details of a particular narrative*


* The right to buy and sell copies of ideas is uncontroversial; **the right to control how people who have legitimately obtained copies of ideas use those ideas is disputed**

> *Why should creators have the right to control how purchasers make use of an idea or creation? This gives creators a monopoly over the idea.*

* The property rights of idea purchasers are as important as the property rights of idea producers


* Many believe intellectual property rights are justified because they are necessary for scientific and artistic development, but the evidence is not in their favor
