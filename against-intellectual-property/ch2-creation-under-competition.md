# Chapter 2: Creation Under Competition


* Intellectual monopoly includes patents, copywrights, and restrictive licensing agreements

* The basic thesis of this book is that intellectual monopoly is unnecessary

    * The basic thesis of this chapter is that *Most innovations have taken place without the benefit of intellectual monopoly.*

    * Industries without intellectual monopoly not only survive, but thrive

* Today's system of intellectual property is a recent invention

## Case Study: Open Source Software

* *Will it surprise you to learn that virtually none of the innovations in this industry took place with the protection of intellectual monopoly?*

* Before 1981, software was not patentable (it could be copyrighted, but violations were rarely enforced)

* Bill Gates: *If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today.*

> *It is when ideas run out and new competitors come in with fresher ideas that those bereft of them turn to government intervention - and intellectual "property"to protect their lucrative old ways of doing business.* (cf. Microsoft)

* *Thousands of productive and highly paid programmers voluntarily choose to produce and market software products that are distributed freely to end users and to other developers. This must surely lead one to question the common assumption that - without copyright and patents - the information technology revolution would have not come about, or that it will die in the years to come.*

* The success of open source is not unique: *We could tell of similar wonders in the American automobile industry, the Swiss and German chemical industries, the worldwide oxygen steelmaking industries, the Italian textile and fashion industries, the Swiss watch industry, the wine farms of Europe and California, the Czech and Venetian glass industries, and so on and so forth.*

* How can software companies make money without copyright? What about piracy?
    * Red Hat Linux is an example of a successful open source company
        * Other companies sell Red Hat distros for less, but most people buy from Red Hat anyway, despite the significantly higher price, because they offer better support

## Case Study: The 19th-Century American Book Market

* No copyright for authors

* Authors sold manuscripts to American publishers, who had  incentive to saturate the market ASAP before pirate publishers could

* This led to reasonable prices for books (*A Christmas Carol*, for example, sold for $2.50 in England vs. 6 cents in the US), which in turn led to a dramatic increase in literacy

* Authors still did well, sometimes even better than in England, which did have copyright laws

* Upshot: selling the right to first publication is what would make creators money in the absence of intellectual monopoly

    * They may not be able to make as much as they potentially can today using intellectual monopoly laws, but certainly enough to maintain economic incentives

## Case Study: The Music Industry

* Why is music piracy so prevalent?

* MP3s are easily and cheaply copied and shared, which raises the question: *Will a good product sold at a reasonable price [end up being] widely distributed for free?*

* The ebook industry provides evidence that the answer to this question is "not necessarily"

    * Fictionwise.com: DRM-free books sold as well as or better than DRM books (at least in 2005), contrary to the idea that DRM books should sell better because they're harder to pirate

    * *In the end, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that it is the unpopularity of the music industry with its customers, combined with the inferiority of the "legitimate" product, that has led to the widespread giving away of MP3s for the cost of personal time and bandwidth. In the case of products sold in a superior form at a reasonable price, there appears to be little effort to trade them on peer-to-peer networks - so much so that the unencrypted product outsells the encrypted version.*

## Case Study: Pornography

* Copyright is less enforced or abused in the porn industry, but the industry thrives anyway
* Cheap and easy copying and distribution of videos dethroned entrenched monopolies like Playboy and Hustler
* Ease of entry means many players and more reasonable returns
