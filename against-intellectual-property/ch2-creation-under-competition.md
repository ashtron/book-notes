# Chapter 2: Creation Under Competition


* Intellectual monopoly includes patents, copywrights, and restrictive licensing agreements
* The basic thesis of this book is that intellectual monopoly is unnecessary
    * The basic thesis of this chapter is that "Most innovations have taken place without the benefit of intellectual monopoly."
* Today's system of intellectual property is a recent invention


## Case Study: Software


* "Will it surprise you to learn that virtually none of the innovations in this industry took place with the protection of intellectual monopoly?"
* Before 1981, software was not patentable (it could be copyrighted, but violations were rarely enforced)
* Bill Gates (ironically): "if people had understood how patents would be granted when most of today's ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today."
> *It is when ideas run out and new competitors come in with fresher ideas that those bereft of them turn to government intervention - and intellectual "property" - to protect their lucrative old ways of doing business.* (cf. Microsoft)


### Open Source


* "Thousands of productive and highly paid programmers voluntarily choose to produce and market software products that are distributed freely to end users and to other developers. This must surely lead one to question the common assumption that - without copyright and patents - the information technology revolution would have not come about, or that it will die in the years to come."
* The success of open source is not unique: "We could tell of similar wonders in the American automobile industry, the Swiss and German chemical industries, the worldwide oxygen steelmaking industries, the Italian textile and fashion industries, the Swiss watch industry, the wine farms of Europe and California, the Czech and Venetian glass industries, and so on and so forth."
* How can software companies make money without copyright? What about piracy?
    * Red Hat
        Other companies sell Red Hat distros for less, but most people buy from Red Hat anyway because they offer better support services




* What about literature, music, movies, etc.?
